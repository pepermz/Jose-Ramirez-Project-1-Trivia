# Jose-Ramirez-Project-1-Trivia

## Project Idea
For this project I will be creating a fun trivia game that allows the user to answer questions between a set amount of time, the player will have different categories to choose from and will have 30 seconds to answer each question before the time runs out and moves to another question. The game ends finally when the player answers three questions wrong.

### Technologies Used
For this project I intend to use mostly Javascript, HTML, CSS and implement Bootstrap as a framework for CSS
